      <p class="aboutParagraph">I have experience with both back end and front end development, however,
        my passion and allegiance lie with front end development. Additionally,
        I have a background in graphic design and find great joy in combining my two skill sets.
        Please check out my repertoire below to see the technologies I have worked with and peruse
        through some of my projects.
